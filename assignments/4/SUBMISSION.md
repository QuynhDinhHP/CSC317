### 🧮 Description (≈150 words)
This project is a web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and includes utility buttons such as clear (AC), percentage (%), and sign toggle (+/-).  
The interface is responsive and supports multiple themes (dark, light, and glass) as well as background image options.  
The JavaScript handles keyboard input, error detection (e.g., division by zero), and dynamic display updates.  
The design emphasizes accessibility, readability, and user experience with clean CSS styling and clear button layout.

### ⚙️ Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was handling the "%" operator and preventing invalid expressions like multiple decimals or dividing by zero.  
I solved this by adding condition checks in JavaScript and using "try ... catch" for error handling.

### 📚 Acknowledgment
I used several YouTube tutorials to help me understand how to structure the calculator logic, handle button clicks, and manage operators and display updates in JavaScript. These videos helped me learn general techniques for building basic calculators and organizing functions.
